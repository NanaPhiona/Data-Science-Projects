A walk through of the projects that i have practiced to prove my Data Science skills. The projects have enabled me to scale my knowledge in Data Science. 
And when working on these projects, I followed the Data Science life cycle;
1. Identifying the problem
2. Data collection
3. Data Processing/ Data preparation
4. Data Analysis
5. Data Modeling
